# Adam Mirza's Dotfiles

## Installation

### stow
The dotfiles can be symlinked using stow from this directory.

```bash
$ stow . --dotfiles
```

### lunarvim
Installing lunarvim is a little bit more involved. You should be able to run the env-setup.sh script in the `scripts` direcory.
First, the correct dependency installs need to be uncommented in the `env-setup.sh` script.
